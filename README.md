# Expense App
Spring-boot and Postgresql make this happen. 
## What have I learned?
- Get to know  OOP and different types of relationships in RDBMS in more detail.
- More understanding of Rest API and MVC architecture.
- Perform DB query operations HQL and JPA Criteria.
- Authentication and Authorization with the help of Spring Security and  JWT.
- Slice of Junit and Mockito for testing

## What can it do?
- Basically, it keeps track of my spent.
- Its purpose is to receive every request and send back response data to my [Vue app](https://github.com/phucnguyenavn/vue_expense).
- Mostly CRUD, Pagination, Report, simple user management.
